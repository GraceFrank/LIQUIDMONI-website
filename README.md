## WHAT AM I WORKING ON?

    1. The Homepage, and its styling.
    2. The About Page, content and its styling.
    3. The Sass files and their configurations.

    <!-- Do it this way. -->
    - Group sass files, add all variables, functions, mixins, and other usefuls before coding.

    - Style Homepage contents by contents (section by section) using sass methodologies.

    - Go to the about page, and do the same.

    - Go to the contact page, curl out a layout and implement it on the page to be ready for the email form (verification) logic.

    - Work on mobile responsiveness, for each page and contents.

    - For the frequently asked questions page, use the same contents on the home page on it.

    - review to team.
